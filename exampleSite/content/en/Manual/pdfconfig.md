In this theme, the following config files are used to generate the configuration file / cover page (table of contents) / colophon used in vivliostyle:

* _pdf.md
* _pdfcolophon.md

By placing these two files in the directory where you want to generate the PDF on your site, you can generate the configuration file for PDF generation (not just in the site root).

## _pdf.md

`_pdf.md` is the config file and cover page template for vivliostyle. It should be described as follows:

```toml
