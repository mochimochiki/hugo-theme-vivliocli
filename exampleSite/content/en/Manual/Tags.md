You can tag your pages, which allows them to be categorized and linked to from a page displaying all tags.

## Page displaying all tags

If there is at least one page that has been tagged, a link to the page displaying all tags will be displayed below the language selector in the menu.

## How to tag

To tag a page, all you need to do is declare a list of tags to be added to the page in its front matter like so: `tags: ["tagA", "tagB"]`. This will enumerate the tags on the page displaying all tags.
